UDP Related:
1. The UDP "Server" never closes.
Because of this, the data from any previous iterations are saved.
i. Can't send any message with a longer size

2. The UDP server loses packets, so the client can't continue.

Solution: Add a timeout to client where if it takes too long, you send the next set of packets and "skip" the old set.


3. Once packet is lost and the loop is broken, it would add the incomplete set of data to the data table.

Solution: Add a loopBroken boolean that checks if the loop was broken prematurely.
